            <p>Turtles are diapsids of the order Testudines (or Chelonii) characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield. 
                "Turtle" may refer to the order as a whole (American English) or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling testudines (British English). 
                The order Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species. The earliest known members of this group date from 220 million years ago, making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians. 
                Of the 356 known species alive today, some are highly endangered.
                Turtles are ectotherms—animals commonly called cold-blooded—meaning that their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment. 
                However, because of their high metabolic rate, leatherback sea turtles have a body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water. 
                Turtles are classified as amniotes, along with other reptiles, birds, and mammals. Like other amniotes, turtles breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water.
                The study of turtles is called cheloniology, after the Greek word for turtle. It is also sometimes called testudinology, after the Latin name for turtles.

            <p>
                Seahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is the name given to 45 species of small marine fish in the genus Hippocampus. 
                "Hippocampus" comes from the Ancient Greek hippokampos (ἱππόκαμπος hippókampos), itself from hippos (ἵππος híppos) meaning "horse" and kampos (κάμπος kámpos) meaning "sea monster". 
                Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail. 
                Seahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate saltwater throughout the world, from about 45°S to 45°N. 
                They live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, and mangroves. 
                Four species are found in Pacific waters from North America to South America. In the Atlantic, H. erectus ranges from Nova Scotia to Uruguay. H. zosterae, known as the dwarf seahorse, is found in the Bahamas.
                Colonies have been found in European waters such as the Thames Estuary.
                Three species live in the Mediterranean Sea: H. guttulatus (the long-snouted seahorse), H. hippocampus (the short-snouted seahorse), and H. fuscus (the sea pony). 
                These species form territories; males stay within 1 m2 (11 sq ft) of habitat, while females range about one hundred times that.

            <p>
                An anchor is a device, normally made of metal, used to connect a vessel to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current. 
                The word derives from Latin ancora, which itself comes from the Greek ἄγκυρα (ankura).
                Anchors can either be temporary or permanent. Permanent anchors are used in the creation of a mooring, and are rarely moved; a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them. 
                Vessels carry one or more temporary anchors, which may be of different designs and weights. 
                A sea anchor is a drogue, not in contact with the seabed. It is used to control a drifting vessel, or to limit the speed of a sailing yacht running "under bare poles" in a storm.
